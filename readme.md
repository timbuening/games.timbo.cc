# games.timbo.cc main readme
[games.timbo.cc](https://games.timbo.cc) is a place, where you can play browser games that are free and open source. I try to remove all of the crappy annoying shit, like analytics and coin-miners from the source code, so you can play the games and **only** the games. If you want to help out, let me know.  
If you have suggestions about games that i could add, let me know also.  
Or, just contribute yourself! :)
