# games.timbo.cc main readme
[games.timbo.cc](https://games.timbo.cc) is a place, where you can play browser games that are free and open source. I try to remove all of the crappy annoying shit, like analytics and coin-miners from the source code, so you can play the games and **only** the games. If you want to help out, let me know.  
If you have suggestions about games that i could add, let me know also.  
Or, just contribute yourself! :) 

latest build and push to self hosted github-pages at games.timbo.cc: 2021-02-09 22:45 CET

## todo
* add the games as submodules from forks of the originals (to make sure no analytics get through) but also keep it simpler to update the games 
* option to dark-mode
